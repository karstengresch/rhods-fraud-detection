## Instructor Documentation
This instructor documentation is for the **Machine Learning Workflows on RHODS** workshop. It is a workshop that uses simple fraud detection as an example: [RHODS fraud  detection](https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/rhods-fraud-detection). Participants will be able to analyze credit card fraud data and model the data using RHODS and Jupyter notebooks. They will then create and package an application in OpenShift.

### Ordering the Demo
When ordering the workshop on RHPDS, select any number of users >1. Keep **Configure Let's Encrypt Certificates** selected and leave **GuidGrabber Lab Key (optional)** blank.

Once the deployment is complete, you will eventually receive an email giving you an access code and a link to send out to participants. There are two links in this email, but the one you will send out to your participants follows: **The GuidGrabber client is available to your users at**. You will need to send both the access code and the link to your participants.

### GuidGrabber Client
Once you open the GuidGrabber client, you will see this view. Participants will enter in the access code and their email.

This is the next screen participants will see. They have access to the lab guide, ODH dashboard and OpenShift console. The username and password for logging into the ODH dashboard and OpenShift console are highlighted on this page. From there, direct them to the repository for instructions on how to begin the lab.
